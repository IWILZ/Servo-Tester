# Servo-Tester
How to test mini and medium servos before use them.


This project can help a R/C modeller to check and select the best servos for his model testing it's power consumption and work before mounting it into a model or a robot.
To do this we will use a power source to provide about 6, 5.3 or 4.6Vcc an ammeter module INA219 and a TFT color display (128x160px) connected to an Arduino.

A potentiometer, an external power supply monitoring (in the range 9-12Vcc) and some buttons complete the device.

The servo movement under test can be MANUAL or AUTOMATIC and an additional function allows you to estimate the overall consumption of the on-board system (excluding the consumption of any electric engine).

At the moment (due to power consumption) this device can only be used for SMALL and MEDIUM sized servos and in any case:
