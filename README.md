# Servo-Tester
How to test mini and medium servos before use them
This project can help a R/C modeller to check and select the best servos for his model testing it's power consumption and work before mounting it into a model or a robot.
To do this we will use a power source to provide about 6, 5.3 or 4.6Vcc an ammeter module INA219 and a TFT color display (128x160px) connected to an Arduino.
